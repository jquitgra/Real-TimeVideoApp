# Real-TimeVideoApp
Here I am going to work on developing a peer-to-peer video application for mobile devices with chat.

TODO:
I want to include a cool backend functionality and expore some speak translation api's or maybe build a model myself to use (who knows?)
Demonstrate:
-Knowledge of APIs
-System Architecture



Note:
This is a weekend project. So whatever I get done will be showcasing my ability to explore a new idea and put it into a working prototype.
